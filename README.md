# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic dataset using **Logistic Regression** with hyperparameter tuning.

##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to improve model performance using:
- DecisionTree Classifier
- GridSearchCV
- Cross Validation

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## ⚙ Model Workflow
1. Data preprocessing
2. Train-test split
3. Model training
4. Hyperparameter optimization
5. Performance evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

##  Result
Model performance was compared before and after hyperparameter tuning.
